ServeSmart Military Object Detection

Authors:
- Raj Kumar
- Sahil Sejal Shah

Model:
- YOLOv8s (Ultralytics)
- COCO pretrained weights

Description:
This project trains a YOLOv8s object detection model on a 12-class military dataset.
The model is optimized for efficiency and robustness using data augmentation and
early stopping. Predictions are generated in YOLO format with confidence scores.

How to Run:
1. Install dependencies: ultralytics, torch, opencv
2. Train using the notebook
3. Run inference using best.pt on test images
